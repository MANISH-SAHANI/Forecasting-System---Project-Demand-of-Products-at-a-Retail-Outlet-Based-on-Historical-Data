### Project Title
Forecasting System - Project Demand of Products at a Retail Outlet Based on Historical Data

### Project Description
**Project Objective & Brief** : Here I have developed a forecasting system with the help of ARIMA models and facebook's prophet library. This for forecasting system is used for predicting the demand for products at a retail outlet based on historical data.

### Project Guidelines :
1. Create a dataset , clean the dataset and also sanitize it.
2. Choose the appropriate forecasting model for the dataset.
3. Fit the model to dataset and make predictions
4. Visualize the predictions

### Expected Project Outcome:
1. Learn about different forecasting models like ARMA and ARIMA.
2. Get familiar with python libraries like numpy, pandas, statsmodels and prophet.
3. Get familiar with industry type projects.
4. Visualize the predictions.

### Requirements:
1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Windows O.S.(optional)

### Libraries Used
 - Pandas
 - NumPy
 - Seaborn
 - itertools
 - Fbprophet
 - MatPlotlib
 - Statsmodel
 - Sci-Kit Learn
